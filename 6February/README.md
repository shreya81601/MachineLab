<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>For my Interactive Media Machine lab Class, in the past 2 weeks, we have built crank mechanism with a cam, crank and slider attached to a motor. The basic structure is built using cardboard while other recyclable materials like bottle caps, starws, sticks, etc. have also been used.</p>

<h2>My Experience</h2>
<p>I had a lot of fun working on this project. I have never realy worked with mechanics before and I thoroughly enjoyed, vutting, measuring, glueing and making something that actually works. It was not as easy at it seemed though. I ran into mnay problems.</p>
