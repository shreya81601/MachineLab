<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>For my Interactive Media Machine lab Class, in the past 2 weeks, we have built crank mechanism with a cam, crank and slider attached to a motor (a cardboard automata). The basic structure is built using cardboard while other recyclable materials like bottle caps, starws, sticks, etc. have also been used.</p>

<h3>My Experience</h3>
<p>I had a lot of fun working on this project. I have never realy worked with mechanics before and I thoroughly enjoyed cutting, measuring, glueing and making something that actually works after it actually collapsed. It was not as easy at it seemed but running into issues and then learning how to fix them was both fascinating and encouraging.</p>

<h2>Technical Problems</h2>
<p>I ran into many problems some of which are:
  <ol>
    <li>Building the basic structure with the crank was somewhat easy. I did not run into many problems here but just one that the stick for the crank was too short and the straw was longer than it should've so it stuck and the crank was not able to move up and down. I changed the stick and cut short the straw accordingly.
    <li>The most disasterous was when I connected the motor. Almost the entire structure fell apart. The glue was not enough and I believe there was not enough surface area in contact to keep the parts attached and strong enough to sustain the force put by the motor. many of the triangles came off and pther parts flew away as a result. I made bigger triangles then and put a lot more glue to hold the structure in place this time.
