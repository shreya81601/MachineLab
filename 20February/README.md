# Rough First Draft for Clock Mechanism
<h2> A MATHEMTICAL CLOCK </h2>

My life has mostly revolved around mathematics - learning, teaching, solving logical puzzels, playing math games, researching, etc. 
<br>So, when I got to the chance to design my own clock, of course I searched for math inspirations!
Also, whenever Ithink of a clock, I am remnded of houses - maybe because of the cuckoo clock I had in my home as a kid which had a house structure at the top. Also, there are many house clocks I have seen growing up and my childhoos was spent with doll houses, I wanted to incorporate this theme in my clock as well. Here are some inspirations photos I looked at:

While searching, then it finally hit!! The Montly Hall math problem combines both these ideas of mine - math and a house!
<br>Below is an exaplantion video of what the Montly Hall problem is:

And this is how it inspired my clock mechanism idea and how I incorporated it:
