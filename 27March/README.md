# Prototype 1

So for this week, we prototyped 2 things -

<ol>
	<li>
		<h3>The Waves<h3>
		<p>
			We decided to try and make the wave this week so that we can see how it looks and alter our mechanism or make changes accordingly. If the wave does not look like one, we may need to come up with a new idea for its working!
		</p>
		<p>
			We implemented the crank shaft mechanism for this purpose. We had various cranks of different sizes to achieve the desired motion. However, the first attempt was an epic fail. We could not get it to work. There were various problems in our protoypt, the circles were not smooth, the shaft was not sturdy, and the wave wasn't smooth, and the ppoieces were turning. See the video below:

			Then we remade the model to fix this. Joined another shaft, smoothened the circles, and made the stcik base long rectangles so rotation is not stuck. This fixed the working of the model but not the look of it as a wave. For that, I joined all the pieces with a string. This not only fixed the problem of the wave pieces rotating but also smoothened the wave out because motion of each subsequent piece is now dependent on the previous one since they are linked via the string.
