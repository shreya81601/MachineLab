# Prototype 1

So for this week, we prototyped 2 things -

<ol>
	<li>
		<h3>The Waves<h3>
		<p>
			Wev decided to try and make the wave this week so that we can see how it looks and alter our mechanism or make changes accordingly. If the wave does not look like one, we may need to come up with a new idea for its working!
		</p>
		<p>
			We implemented the crank shaft mechanism for this purpose. We had various cranks of different sizes to achieve the desired motion.

	<li>
		<h3>The Sun<h3>

		</p>
</ol>
